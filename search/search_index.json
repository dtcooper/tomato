Installation \u2190 Follow these steps to get started. Docker Installation You'll need to install Docker to get started (which now comes preloaded with Compose ). Linux Instructions macOS Instructions On Linux, execute the following at the command line to install Docker, curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh You can install Docker Desktop by following the instructions here . At the command line clone and enter Tomato's git repository , then copy over the .env configuration file. git clone https://github.com/dtcooper/tomato.git cd tomato/server cp .env.sample .env Development Mode Production Deployment Open up the .env file you just created using your favourite text editor. Action on the following, Set DEBUG flag to 1 \u2014 which tells Tomato to run in development mode. Now, create a symbolic link for the development Compose overrides, ln -s docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.overrides.yml Now bring up the server, docker compose up In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000 . The default username and password, which you can (and should) change will be tomato and tomato . To stop the server, press Ctrl + C . Open up the .env file you just created using your favourite text editor. Take action on the following, Set DEBUG flag to 0 \u2014 which tells Tomato to run in production mode.

Either set EMAIL_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED to 0 to disable emails, or set it to 1 and edit all EMAIL_* values point to a properly configured SMTP server DOMAIN_NAME and CERTBOT_EMAIL must be properly set! If you don't set DOMAIN_NAME and CERTBOT_EMAIL properly as described above, the production Nginx container will not start correctly. This is a requirement of Certbot , the underlying component that automatically generates an SSL certificate for you.
