Think individual advertisements, individual public service announcements, or individual station IDs. Audio assets always have a name and underlying audio file, like an mp3 but can contain additional data like when they begin and end airing, or whether their enabled at all. Audio Asset Example And example would be a short advertisement audio clip named \"David's Steel Guitar Ad.\" Rotator \u2190 A collection of audio assets. A rotator represents a way to categorize audio assets into the same group. An audio asset can belong to more than one rotator, but in practice, they won't. Rotator Example From the audio asset example above, you might put \"David's Steel Guitar Ad\" along with other short ads for musical instruments in the \"Musical Instrument Ads\" rotator. Stop Set \u2190 A stop set is an ordered list of rotators. A stop set can be thought of as an entire commercial break, like in traditional radio. One audio asset is selected at random 1 for each rotator in a stop set. A rotator can can be in a stop set more than once. If that sounds a bit confusing to you, see the example below. Stop Set Example Let's say we have the following rotators, each several audio assets in them, Rotator Audio Assets in Rotator Station IDs S_ID_1 , S_ID_2 , and S_ID_3 Public Service Announcements PSA_1 , PSA_2 , and PSA_3 Advertisements AD_1 , AD_2 , and AD_3 Then we have an \"Evening Stop Set\", which contains this an ordered list of five rotators, shown here, Index Rotator 1 Station IDs 2 Advertisements 3 Advertisements (repetition allowed) 4 Public Service Announcements 5 Station IDs Then, when an \"Evening Stop Set\" is generated to be played by Tomato during a commercial break, Tomato plays through the following five randomly selected audio assets. Index Audio Asset (Randomly Selected) 1 S_ID_2 \u2014 selected from Station IDs 2 AD_3 \u2014 selected from Advertisements 3 AD_1 \u2014 selected from Advertisements 4 PSA_2 \u2014 selected from Public Service Announcements 5 S_ID_1 \u2014 selected from Station IDs Random Weight \u2190 The weight of how likely random selection occurs of an item occurs, when compared to all other items in a set. The default random weight with Tomato is always 1 . Random weight is used when Tomato selects both audio assets and stop sets. The likeliness of an item x being selected is calculated as follows, \\text{chance of selection of item} = \\frac{\\text{random weight of item}}{\\text{sum all of item random weights}} \\text{chance of selection of item} = \\frac{\\text{random weight of item}}{\\text{sum all of item random weights}} Random Weight Example If an audio asset \"A\" has a weight of 2 and all other audio assets have a weight of 1 , then asset \"A\" is twice as likely to be selected when compares to all other assets. The random selection process can be biased by random weight. \u21a9","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"concepts/#core-concepts-explained","text":"","title":"Core Concepts, Explained"},{"location":"concepts/#glossary-of-terms","text":"","title":"Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"concepts/#audio-asset","text":"A short, individual audio track.

Installation \u2190 Follow these steps to get started. Docker Installation You'll need to install Docker to get started (which now comes preloaded with Compose ). Linux Instructions macOS Instructions On Linux, execute the following at the command line to install Docker, curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh You can install Docker Desktop by following the instructions here . At the command line clone and enter Tomato's git repository , then copy over the .env configuration file. git clone https://github.com/dtcooper/tomato.git cd tomato/server cp .env.sample .env Development Mode Production Deployment Open up the .env file you just created using your favourite text editor. Action on the following, Set DEBUG flag to 1 \u2014 which tells Tomato to run in development mode. Now, create a symbolic link for the development Compose overrides, ln -s docker-compose.dev.yml docker-compose.overrides.yml Build the containers (or pull them by instead executing docker compose pull ), docker compose build Generating Sample Data If you just want to demo Tomato with loads of prefilled sample data, run this command, docker compose run --rm app ./manage.py prefill_sample_data --created-by tomato Now bring up the server, docker compose up In your web browser, navigate to http://localhost:8000 . The default username and password, which you can (and should) change will be, Username Password tomato tomato To stop the server, press Ctrl + C . Open up the .env file you just created using your favorite text editor. Take action on the following, Set DEBUG flag to 0 \u2014 which tells Tomato to run in production mode. Either set EMAIL_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED to 0 to disable emails, or set it to 1 and edit all EMAIL_* values to point to a properly configured SMTP server DOMAIN_NAME is set to a domain name that resolves to a publicly accessible IP address of the server. Setting Up an Nginx Container Reverse Proxying Yourself It's highly recommended that you use the production Nginx container, which automatically generates an SSL certificate for you and takes care of reverse proxying into Tomato for you. To do so, first make sure of the following in your .env file, CERTBOT_EMAIL is set to a valid email. DOMAIN_NAME and CERTBOT_EMAIL must be properly set! If you don't set DOMAIN_NAME and CERTBOT_EMAIL properly as described above, the production Nginx container will not start correctly. This is a requirement of Certbot , the underlying component that automatically generates an SSL certificate for you. Now, create a symbolic link for the Nginx overrides, ln -s docker-compose.nginx.yml docker-compose.overrides.yml Reverse proxying yourself is NOT recommended. This is method of setting up Tomato on your server is unsupported, and not recommended. However, here is a guide for non-standard setups, or if you don't have port 80 and 443 available on your server. Create and edit a file named docker-compose.overrides.yml , server/docker-compose.overrides.yml services : app : ports : # Replace 1234 with any port you like - 127.0.0.1:1234:8000 Then in your web server, reverse proxy into port you chose. If you're using Nginx , you can use configuration like this, sample.conf server { # ... other Nginx config here location /assets/ { # Replace /home/user/tomato with the path you cloned the repository alias /home/user/tomato/server/serve/assets/ ; } location /static/ { # Replace /home/user/tomato here too alias /home/user/tomato/server/serve/static/ ; } location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; # Replace 1234 with the port you chose above proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:1234 ; } } Pull the containers (or build them by instead executing docker compose build ), docker compose pull Create an admin user by following the instructions after typing this at the command line, docker compose run --rm app ./manage.py createsuperuser Now bring up the server, docker compose up -d Head over to https://<DOMAIN_NAME>/ in your web browser.
